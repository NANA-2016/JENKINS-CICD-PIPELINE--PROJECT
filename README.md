Located the key using the command cd Downloads as the key is located in the downloads file .
I made the key not to be accessed publicly by running the command "chmod 400 Nana.pem"
Used the command "ssh -i "Nana.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-49-68-73.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com" to connect to the instance .
